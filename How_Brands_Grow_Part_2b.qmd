# How Brands Grow, Part 2 – Revised Edition (Romaniuk & Sharp 2023)

The **Revised Edition** builds upon the 2015/2019 *Part 2* volume.\
Its purpose remains to extend the **Ehrenberg-Bass empirical laws of
growth** into new categories and contexts, but it adds updated data,
global cases, and refined interpretations of “mental” and “physical”
availability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Overview of the Revision

| Focus area | What’s new or revised | Continuity with earlier edition |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Scope of evidence** | Broader database across 90 + countries, 100 + categories, and thousands of brands, including B2B, luxury, and digital services. | Retains cross-category empirical approach. |
| **Mental & physical availability** | Expanded treatment; new chapters integrate *distinctive assets*, *category entry points (CEPs)*, and brand *mental networks*. | Builds on original Part 2 discussion of availability; now grounded in Romaniuk’s *Building Distinctive Brand Assets* framework. |
| **Services & durables** | New empirical work showing the same “laws” hold in high-involvement and infrequent-purchase categories. | Earlier edition discussed these qualitatively. |
| **Private labels & retailer brands** | Separate analysis of supermarket and online retailers as brands; duplication and double jeopardy hold. | Private-label data previously limited. |
| **Digital & omnichannel** | First systematic inclusion of online media and e-commerce data; demonstrates that digital channels obey the same reach/penetration logic. | Not covered in 2015/2019. |
| **Luxury & premium pricing** | Empirical correction: luxury brands still rely on scale and mental availability; loyalty remains low and repertoire buying high. | Conceptually anticipated earlier, now supported by data. |
| **Emerging markets** | Expanded datasets from Asia, Africa, and Latin America; confirms universality of NBD–Dirichlet patterns. | Earlier edition relied mostly on OECD markets. |
| **Brand health tracking** | Adds “mental availability metrics” (e.g., % linked to category entry points) as leading indicators of future share. | Earlier edition centred on market-share outcomes. |
| **Terminology and pedagogy** | Simplified graphics, clearer “laws” language, and teaching examples. | Continuity of empirical tone and reader style. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Updated Structure (approximate correspondence)

| Revised Edition (2023) | Earlier Edition (2015/2019) | Main evolution |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Ch 1–2 The scientific laws of growth** | Introductory chapters | Adds “What makes a law” and updated replication evidence. |
| **Ch 3 How buyers really buy** | Buying behaviour & loyalty patterns | Adds repertoire graphics and buyer-mix illustrations. |
| **Ch 4–5 Double jeopardy and duplication of purchase** | Same | Uses expanded 2020s database; now includes private labels. |
| **Ch 6 Penetration as the driver of growth** | “Penetration, not loyalty” | Same message with fresher longitudinal data. |
| **Ch 7 Physical availability revisited** | Availability in services & durables | Broader channels (digital, delivery, distribution). |
| **Ch 8–9 Mental availability and distinctive assets** | Mental availability | Merges Romaniuk’s CEP & asset research into main text. |
| **Ch 10 Brand extensions and portfolios** | Line extensions | Refines overlap and extension equations (Dirichlet logic). |
| **Ch 11 Services, B2B, and luxury** | New section | Applies laws beyond FMCG. |
| **Ch 12 Practical implications for marketers** | Managerial implications | Condensed, data-driven prescriptions. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Core Empirical Laws (unchanged but reinforced)

| Law | Essence | Updated evidence |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **1. Double Jeopardy** | Small brands suffer twice—low penetration and slightly less loyalty. | Holds across B2B, luxury, and online contexts. |
| **2. Duplication of Purchase** | Brands share customers in proportion to market share. | Verified with \> 10,000 duplication matrices. |
| **3. Natural monopoly of larger brands** | Heavy category buyers buy big brands more often. | Universally replicated. |
| **4. Penetration drives loyalty** | Loyalty follows penetration mechanically. | Same law; illustrated for infrequent categories. |
| **5. Mental availability is key** | Memory structures determine probability of choice. | Now operationalised via CEP metrics. |
| **6. Physical availability multiplies reach** | Distribution breadth × ease of purchase. | Extended to e-commerce & last-mile access. |
| **7. Distinctive brand assets build mental reach** | Colour, shape, sound cues increase recognition. | Integrated from Romaniuk (2018). |
| **8. Consistency over creativity** | Repetition and availability outperform differentiation. | Re-emphasised with digital ad data. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quantitative Underpinnings (unchanged)

The Revised Edition still bases all empirical regularities on the\
**Negative Binomial–Dirichlet** model:

$$
P(X_i = x_i) = 
\int P(x_i \mid \mu, k, \alpha_i)\,f(\mu, k)\,d\mu
$$

with the same consequences:

-   $D_{ij} \approx s_j$ (duplication),
-   $p_i \propto s_i$ (penetration–share relationship),
-   $\text{Overlap}_{ij} \approx s_i + s_j - (1-s_j)^{s_i/s_j}$
    (extension overlap).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Additions in Managerial Guidance

| Theme | Revised insight |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| **Mental availability metrics** | Introduces *Category Entry Points* (CEPs): situations, needs, or occasions linked to the brand. Brand health ≈ % of CEPs mentally associated. |
| **Distinctive assets** | Empirically scored on fame × uniqueness grid; tracked like distribution. |
| **Service brands** | “Availability” translated into ease-of-contact, hours, online access, response time. |
| **Luxury** | Even “exclusive” brands obey the same duplication logic—true differentiation is minimal. |
| **Digital marketing** | Reach \> engagement; law of buyer heterogeneity still dominates. |

::: {.callout-tip title="Managerial Implications from the Revised Edition"}
-   **Growth = more buyers**: Loyalty follows penetration; reach remains
    paramount.\
-   **Mental + Physical availability** are twin levers: build memory and
    access.\
-   **Distinctive assets** act as distribution cues in memory—track and
    refresh them.\
-   **Brand portfolios** share customers; overlap is expected, not
    cannibalisation.\
-   **The empirical laws are universal**: same patterns hold across
    price tiers, categories, and nations.

# The Category Entry Point (CEP) Framework

The Revised Edition translates “mental availability” from a theoretical
construct into a measurable, trackable system based on **Category Entry
Points (CEPs)** and **Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conceptual Flow

> **Category Entry Points → Distinctive Assets → Mental Availability →
> Brand Choice**

1.  **Category Entry Points (CEPs)**\
    Situations, occasions, needs, or emotions that *trigger* category
    buying.\
    Examples:

    -   “I’m hungry at lunchtime.”\
    -   “I want to celebrate.”\
    -   “I need a quick caffeine boost.”

2.  **Distinctive Brand Assets (DBAs)**\
    Perceptual cues—logo, colour, tagline, jingle, packaging, shape—that
    connect the brand to memory.\
    DBAs act as *retrieval cues* linking the category entry point to the
    brand.

3.  **Mental Availability**\
    The probability that a buyer *thinks of and can find* the brand when
    a relevant CEP arises.\
    It depends on how many CEPs the brand is linked to, and how strong
    those links are.

4.  **Brand Choice Probability**\
    At the moment of need, the brand with the highest combined mental +
    physical availability is most likely to be chosen.

### CEP Measurement Table

| CEP example | \% buyers who associate brand | Distinctive assets that cue it | Relative strength |
|:-----------------|-----------------:|:-----------------|:-----------------:|
| “Morning energy” | 45 % | Logo colour, tagline “Kickstart your day” | 🔵 High |
| “With friends / socialising” | 35 % | Music cue, packaging colour | 🟢 Medium |
| “After exercise” | 20 % | Bottle shape, sports sponsorship | 🟡 Low |
| “Relaxation / reward” | 15 % | TV ad visuals, jingle | 🟡 Low |

**Interpretation**

-   The more **CEPs** a brand covers, and the stronger each memory link,
    the higher its **mental availability**.\
-   Brands grow by *adding CEPs* (more contexts) and *strengthening
    links* (better cues), not by deepening loyalty in a narrow set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Distinctive Asset Tracking

Each asset is scored on two axes (Romaniuk, 2018):

| Asset | Fame (% recognition) | Uniqueness (% attribution) | Quadrant | Recommended action |
|:--------------|--------------:|--------------:|:--------------|:--------------|
| Logo colour | 90 % | 80 % | 🔵 Strong asset | Maintain and protect |
| Jingle | 70 % | 40 % | 🟢 Emerging | Reinforce with consistent exposure |
| Slogan | 85 % | 20 % | 🟡 Over-shared | Refresh or simplify |
| Mascot | 40 % | 35 % | 🟣 Weak | Re-establish or retire |

These measures allow brands to **track mental availability** just as
they track **physical distribution**—each asset becomes a *memory
distribution point*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Integrated Model Summary

| Layer | Key measure | Managerial implication |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Category Entry Points** | \% of buying occasions linked to the brand | Expand repertoire of triggers |
| **Distinctive Assets** | Fame × Uniqueness index | Refresh and protect distinctive cues |
| **Mental Availability** | Average retrieval strength across CEPs | Wider mental reach → more buyers |
| **Physical Availability** | \% of buying occasions where brand can be bought | Ensure ease of purchase |
| **Brand Choice Probability** | Function of mental × physical availability | Drives penetration and share |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Key Takeaways

::: {.callout-tip title="Managerial Insight"}
-   Build **mental reach** by linking your brand to *many* category
    entry points.\
-   Strengthen **distinctive assets** to make those links easy to
    retrieve.\
-   Track mental availability as a **distribution metric in memory**,
    not a soft perception score.\
-   Brands grow not through “deep loyalty” but through **mental and
    physical accessibility across more buying situations**.
